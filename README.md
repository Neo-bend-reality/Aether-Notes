# Aether Notes
---

A lightweight, python - based notes app. Uses `sqlite3` and `flask` to make a small backend, 
and the tkinter - based frontend (not yet made) handles the logic.

---

## Documentation
The project has sphinx - based docs that use the `furo` theme. The docs are located in /docs.zip/docs. <br>
Make sure to extract the contents first to load the CSS. The docs are :
- `index.html` : The home page
- `db.html` : DB docs 
- The rest is metadata and other files.

---

```bash
