# Aether Notes

A lightweight, python - based notes app. Uses `sqlite3` and `flask` to make a small backend, 
and the tkinter - based frontend (not yet made) handles the logic.

```bash
pip install flask
pip install sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme
pip install furo
```

Finally run the frontend :

python -i frontend.py
```
